    <string name="details_leaf"><![CDATA[Symptoms:
\nSmall brown or tan spots that may have a yellow chlorotic halo appear on lower leaves.

\n\nLeaf spot disease caused by the fungus Helminthosporium can be prevented in the following way:
 \n1. Plow the land before planting to suppressing the seeds of
     pests and diseases in the soil
 \n2. Avoid planting corn too tightly to increase air circulation in
     the plants
 \n3. Destroy the plants affected by leaf spot by burning or
     burying in the holes

\n\nIf it has been diseased, then disease control can be done as follows:
 \n1. Use Foliar fungicide treatment if leaf spot occurs at an early
      stage but it has to be weighed against the weather
      condition.
 \n2. Using a combination of fungicide and varietal resistance.
      Various studies conducted by experts have shown that the
      combination of the application of a fungicide with the
      active ingredient Mankozeb 80%, is able to suppress
      growth and development. Leaf spot disease of maize.
 \n3. Using a varietal resistance.
 \n4. In resistant varieties, the plants contain enzymes secreted
      by the leaf cell walls that are able to fight the aggressive
      nature of the fungal spores. Resistance varieties are
      different each country, but in Indonesia you can use Bisma
      variety]]></string>
    <string name="details_rust">Symptoms:
\nCommon rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia polysora, with symptoms in the form of small spots on the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. This disease attacks many corn plants which are cultivated in low to high areas and are able todevelop well in the rainy and dry seasons.

\n\nNorthern leaf blight can be treated in the following ways:
 \n1. Planting types of corn seeds that are resistant to leaf
        blight, in Indonesia there are lamuru, sukmaraga, palakka,
        and bima 1.
 \n2. Destroy the plant which is infected by common rust.
 \n3. Using fungicide containing benomyl</string>
    <string name="details_blight">Symptoms:
\nThe characteristic sign of corn with northern leaf blight is the formation of lesions on the leaves. They are long, narrow lesions that eventually turn brown. The lesions may also form grayish colored borders around their edges.

\n\nNorthern leaf blight can be treated in the following ways :
 \n1. Planting types of corn seeds that are resistant to leaf blight,
        in indonesia there are semar-2, and rama
 \n2. Destroy the plant by burning the whole stalk of corn
        infected with blight
 \n3. Spraying a fungicide containing active mancozeb or
        dithiocarbamate</string>

    <string name="detail_tip1">Choose certified hybrid corn seeds. In every province in Indonesia, this superior type of corn seed is available. Usually corn seeds have been given seed treatment, namely by coating a fungicide on the seeds which functions to protect the plants from various disease attacks and facilitate the conditions for growing corn plants.</string>
    <string name="detail_tip2"><![CDATA[In general, corn plants can grow in various environmental conditions. For maximum growth, there are several conditions for growing corn plants. The following are the conditions for growing corn plants:

\n\nFor Climate:
    \n- The climate is subtropical or tropical
    \n- The ideal rainfall is 85â€“200 mm/month and should
       be evenly distributed.
    \n- A good optimum temperature is 21-34 C
    \n- The intensity of direct sunlight, at least 8 hours per
       day

\n\nFor soils:
    \n- Have a loose soil texture (do the plowing process
       so that the soil texture is loose).
    \n- Contains enough nutrient content.
    \n- Soil pH 5.5-7.5 (if the soil pH is acidic or <5.5,
       sprinkle dolomite/agricultural lime).
    \n- Have sufficient water availability.
    \n- The slope of the land is less than 8%.]]></string>
    <string name="detail_tip3">In muddy soil conditions, it is best to make beds/mounds so that the seeds are not stagnant with water and do not rot. So the seeds will grow fast and maximum.

\nThe width of the beds is 100 cm and the distance between the beds is 50 cm. The distance in the rows is 20-25 cm, so that the distance for planting corn, whether using beds or not using beds, is 75cm x 25cm or 75cm x 20cm.

\nAfter that, make a planting hole with a hammer as deep as 5-10 cm then add the corn seeds and cover with bokashi. After that, spray with GDM POC on the former planting hole. This serves to accelerate plant growth and protect plants from disease.</string>
